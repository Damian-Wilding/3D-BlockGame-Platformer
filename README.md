# Overview

I'm trying to learn as many programs/languages as possible so that I can be a more valuable programmer/emplyee.

The game is a simple first person 3D platformer. There isn't a goal in the game yet besides just reaching the highest point you can in the level. To play you use the WASD keys to move, the mouse to look around, and the spacebar to jump. 

I've always loved the idea of creating video games and 3D games have always caught my eye. This project is serving as a way for me to learn about Unity and game development as a whole.

# Development Environment

As stated above, I used Unity to make this game.

For the game scripts, I used C#.

# Future Work

* First, I'd like to make it so that there is a winning message when you reach the highest possible point just so you can know that you won. 
* I'd like to add the ability to sprint as well. That could be toggled on and off using a key.
* I also need to shrink the player as well. The player can get stuck in between blocks because they're too big on the X and Y axis.
